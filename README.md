### The Toolbox Project
This is a project for putting utility code - things for statistics, random numbers, graphs, trees, etc.  I have been focusing on the stats stuff lately so the other stuff is still woefully incomplete.
I hope it can be useful for my projects, and maybe others' as well.  It can also be a way of showing code I have written.
